# Components

**1. TestClass**
- _Software:_ JUnit
- _Functionality:_ 
  - Tests that will check that the functions are working properly as development occurs and remain fully functional through the lifetime of the project
  - As you go through the version folders you can see that each time more of the test cases pass as each group of functions are implemented
- _Test Breakdown_: Each testcase checks 4 different values within the valid range. For the trig functions this is done in each of the 4 quadrents
  - test_factorial
  - test_pow
  - test_cos_deg
  - test_cos_rad
  - test_square
  - test_deg2rad
  - test_sin_deg
  - test_sin_rad
  - test_tan_deg
  - test_tan_rad
- _Notes:_ As all functions are to be built by the team the only exception we made was validating that the trig functions using the Java Math functions as the **expected** value

**2. MathLib**
- _Software:_ Java
- _Functionality:_ 
  - The custom math functions
- _Notes:_
